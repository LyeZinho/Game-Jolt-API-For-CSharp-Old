# Game-Jolt-API-For-CSharp
A very bad gamejolt api for C#, please don't use this for real games, this project was just for fun and the code is really messy and is not efficient, so please, don't use this

# DON'T USE THIS PLS
I literally started this project on Visual Studio 2013, Made the rest of it on Visual Studio 2015, and now i'm using Visual Studio 2019
# If you want to contribute, you can do it here on github, or add me on discord MMDDKK#6500
